        "Description": "REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers.  In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code.  Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn't benefitted from this kind of work until recently.  Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services.  We'll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss's RESTful Routing library.",

You'll get a clear understanding of the technology options available on the Microsoft Web Stack. What direction is the web stack going? Does it snap together like LEGO? Let's see what you can build TODAY and tomorrow on the Microsoft Web Platform.",

In C# sometimes you need to copy a value into a variable or method parameter of another type.  You may have an integer variable that you need to pass to a method whose parameter is typed as double. Or you might need to assign a class variable to a variable of an interface type. These kinds of operations are called Type Conversions.

Which we promptly abandoned. The problem is that Agile calls for us to embrace uncertainty, and we are desperately uncomfortable with uncertainty. So much so that we will replace it with anything, even things we know don’t work. We really do prefer the Devil we know.  \r\n  \r\nOver the last year or so Dan has been studying and talking about patterns of effective software delivery.

        "Description": "Already back in 1999 some smart guys came around predicting that mobile would have been the primary focus of development in only a few years. It actually took a bit more than expected but the era of mobile software arrived at last. Why did it take so long? The answer is surprisingly simple: mobile software needed a critical mass of users to take off. The process of users aggregation started probably with the release of the first iPhone back in 2007 but has today a mass large enough to trigger any sort of chain reactions. Back in 1990 (yes, you read it right) Bill Gates gave a keynote talk at Comdex titled “information at your fingertips”. Let’s be honest, for twenty years we pretended we really had information (we needed) at our fingertips. To stay with the paraphrase, at most we had information at hand; not certainly at fingertips. Now it’s the time, though. With devices everywhere, and especially with a revolutionary Windows coming up,  I believe we’re really entering a new era of development—device computing. Device computing is about smart software that understands the device it is running on and intelligently adapts to the user that holds the device. Smart software is inevitably user-centered: where the user is, what the user may be doing, what the user likes, what the user may need. Developing mobile software is overall simple—no matter the myriad of SDKs and languages. The hardest part is finding proper user stories and deriving adequate use-cases from them. Sounds like a deja-vu? Maybe the idea is nothing new; but we never wrote software like this and this is the only software we may be called to write in five years.",

        "Description": "The Agile movement shifted the relationship between clients and developers in a profound way.  In waterfall processes, clients specified large amounts of functionality, then nervously faded into the background until the fateful day-of-delivery.  With Agile, developers strove to engage with clients continuously, and delivered much more frequently against their needs.   A new trust was established.  \r\nAt the Forward Internet Group in London, we are implementing a second major shift between clients and developers.  The trust of the clients in developers evolves into a broader trust of the developers to deliver business value without resorting to a series of well-defined stories.  In essence, the business has empowered the developers to do what they think is right for the business.  This model, popularized by Facebook, has several labels, but the one we prefer for our flavor is Programmer Anarchy.  \r\nWe will start with stock Agile, and begin to apply environmental factors that led us to drop “standard” Agile practices.  We will also watch as well-defined Agile roles evaporate completely as other environmental factors are applied.  Finally, we will arrive at Programmer Anarchy, an organization often following none of the standard Agile practices, having no BA or QA roles, and even missing any managers of programmers.  \r\nWe will summarize our environmental factors, and postulate on the required and optional factors. We will make bold, controversial assertions.  We will back up these assertions with actual experiences.  \r\nProgrammer Anarchy has garnered rave reviews at every conference venue, and is provoking the intended debate on our current Agile thinking.  \r\nTarget Audience Agile-Lean practitioners who are feeling the \"warts\" in their implementations; programmers and project managers",

Some people were asking me if BDD/SpecFlow scales well for projects beyond BookShop? (It does.)  \r\n  \r\nEvery project is different, so their problems are. Still, I have collected a handful ideas that make sense to consider. In this session I would like to show you some of these, through examples from real projects wherever it is possible.

In all types of communication, something gets lost or modified between the sender and the receiver. As projects move in to critical or stressful times, layers of messages will call for the team (and team managers) to stay sharp and to ensure that time isn’t wasted on “too much talk and too little progress”. A lot can be said about intercultural communication. And there’s a lot to be learned from it when working in cross cultural teams. Teams which are separated by boarders, languages, cultures, and backgrounds have more complex challenges compared to local teams. They need to respond quicker and meet expectations in a cultural setting that might be vague or unfamiliar for them. Switching between communication tools and formal/ informal ways of addressing issues will affect the message, and thus can affect the outcome. In this talk, by taking examples from online gamers, I will give the audience useful guidelines and advice on how to create a strategy for their teams when using tools such as IM and email in their distributed projects. I will also talk about the role of the manager in these distributed teams, as many teams are completely virtual and never meet in person.

In this session, I will walk you through the internal storage format of MDF files, how we might go about parsing a complete database ourselves, using nothing but a hex editor.  \r\n  \r\nI will cover how SQL Server stores its own internal metadata about objects, how it knows where to find your data on disk, and once it finds it, how to read it. Using the knowledge from this session, you'll get a solid understanding of the basics behind SQL Server storage.",

However, in the years since the Agile Manifesto, the increasing popularity of agile and the dramatic improvements it brings has pushed it onto larger and larger projects. Additionally, having an entire team--especially on a large project--in one room, or even one building is a luxury no longer enjoyed by many projects.In this presentation, we will look at how agile can be scaled to work on any multi-team project. Even a project with two teams will benefit from learning how to proactively manage interteam dependencies, conduct iteration planning for multiple teams, cultivate communities of practice, and coordinating work. Because so many projects are spread across multiple sites we will also look at overcoming the unique challenges facing distributed teams. We will look at deciding how to distribute a team, how to create coherence among team members, the importance of getting together and when are the most important times to use the travel budget, changes to what the team documents, and how to handle meetings when spread across timezones. Whether your project is spread across two locations in the same city or spread around the globe, you will leave with practical advice to try tomorrow.",

Continuous Delivery is usually implemented as a natural improvement of a Continuous Integration process. This presentation highlights challenges and presents hints on how to start from a raw environment and incrementally build a successful deployment pipeline based on Team Foundation Server (TFS), providing substantial added-value for business. This presentation will describe the process of establishing Continuous Delivery in a project for FIFA. We describe the starting point, what we achieve in the first phases and what are the plans for further improvements in order to deliver high quality software in schedules defined by business needs – not by process and technology constraints. Making Waves took over as a Services Provider for the development and maintenance of FIFA's Intranet and Extranet platform in 2011. The main challenge was to avoid long release cycles, improve quality and provide a reliable hotfix strategy for urgent issues raised in production. The first phase of the project was focused on taking over the source code, development, test and production environments. This was a challenging task, mostly because of a lack of automation in build and deployment processes. This part of the presentation will cover possible approaches for how to incrementally create a flexible development environment, supported by a continuous integration process, in a legacy project inherited from an external part. The goal of the second project phase was to implement a continuous delivery process in the project. We will present the main arguments for investing in tools and processes which enable more frequent and automated releases, and how that brings significant business value. We will also cover how we implemented a set of practices and principles aimed at building, testing and releasing software faster and more frequently, including (but not limited to): deployment automation, release repository, production configuration tracking and version promotion between environments. The presentation will briefly cover tools which were used, including Team Foundation Server (TFS), but most of the content is technology agnostic and is relevant for both developers and more-business oriented people.",

In addition, for fun and laughs, Rob will do a PostGresSQL/MySQL dance-off - discussing some of the \"interesting\" aspects of MySQL and why many DBAs absolutely hate it.",

At the turn of the millennium we found that the benefits gained from the principles and patterns could be amplified by combining them with practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. And now, as the decade is coming to a close, we have found that these principles, patterns, and practices have driven us to define a true profession.

How do you do it?  \r\n  \r\nUsers are experiencing 500 errors for a few underlying reasons, some with workarounds and some without. The customer service call centre need to be able to rapidly triage incoming calls and provide the appropriate workaround where possible, without displaying sensitive exception detail to end users or requiring synchronous logging. At the same time, your team needs to prioritize which bugs to fix first. What’s the right balance of logging, error numbers and correlations ids?  \r\n  \r\nThese are all real scenarios that Tatham Oddie and his fellow consultants have solved on large scale, public websites.

Alan Kay invented object orientation (OO) with its networks of communicating objects to facilitate simple and powerful mental models. His goal was to make computers and programming comprehensible to children of all ages. Mainstream programmers missed the importance of communication in Kay’s OO and misused the term. A better name for their approach is ‘class orientation’.I have extended Kay’s original OO with explicit concepts and code that specify how objects interact at runtime. With this new paradigm, Data-Context-Interaction (DCI), programmers reason about their code, new team members get quickly up to speed, maintainers lead a better and more productive life. The DCI Context is a new abstraction that supplements the ubiquitous class. While a class says everything about the inside of an object and nothing about the objects surrounding it, a DCI Context says everything about a network of communicating objects and nothing about their insides. The class is great for describing autonomous objects such as the domain objects in the Data part of DCI. The Context is great for describing how use cases are realized by networks of communicating objects. Communication is now a first-class citizen of programming.",

With the air gesture controlled apps at our door step and the Leap Motion leading the way, this is a session you don't want to miss. I'll demonstrate the device, go through its inner workings, the API's and the air store. But even more important- there will be code. Let's bring the future to life for a Minority Report 2013 inspired session.",

SPA's focus on delivering better user experiences with significant client-side interactions using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. Now you can get started with SPA using the ASP.NET SPA Template. This session explores the core pieces that help you build end-to-end SPA solutions including code structure and modularity, using data binding and MVVM, abstracted remote data calls, page navigation and routing, app life cycle, and rich data features. Along the way I'll also touch on popular libraries such as Durandal, Knockout, and Breeze.",

        "Description": "In an ideal world, projects begin with a stable database mapping strategy and an empty database schema. Current object-relational mapping tools often use opinionated conventions that make building the persistence layer as you build your domain model a snap. But, what do you do when starting with an existing database structure and applying a new ORM tool? That new opinionated tool can often conflict with the existing structure. In this hour, you will learn how a legacy database and Entity Framework Code First can meet in the middle. As a bonus, you will also learn more about getting the most out of the PowerShell environment that is built into Visual Studio via a tiny little project called SolutionScripts.",

These databases are generally much better than RDBMS at scaling, performance, and ease-of-development (e.g. in NoSQL the object-relational impedance mismatch usually disappears). Unfortunately, many talks on NoSQL are very academic and general. Not this one. This session will introduce the ideas around the so-called NoSQL movement, and we'll learn how to leverage MongoDB (a popular open source NoSQL db) to build .NET applications using LINQ as the data access language. We'll build out a .NET application using LINQ and MongoDB in a series of interactive demos using Visual Studio 2012 and C#.",

Every week someone in the blogosphere is hyping a new methodology, or modifications to an existing one, all of which claim to be the next big thing. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of the methodologies that has outlasted its fad phase and has become a major player in the software development methodology arena. Once you have grasped the methodology there are numerous ways you can make the process easier in the .NET space. In this talk Keith will provide guidance on how to architect your code and solution structure to lend itself to unit testing. He will also dive deep into how you can, using SOLID design principles, write code optimized for testing. He will discuss more complex concepts such as Inversion of Control/Dependency Injection and mocking. Keith will also dive into automated UI testing tools such as WatiN.",

Finally I'll cover how to incorporate other data best practices, and explore how to achieve transaction like behavior across partitions using the Saga Pattern.",
