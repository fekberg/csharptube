      "Description": "REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers.  In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code.  Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn't benefitted from this kind of work until recently.  Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services.  We'll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss's RESTful Routing library.",

      "Description": "REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers.  In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code.  Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn't benefitted from this kind of work until recently.  Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services.  We'll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss's RESTful Routing library.",

      "Description": "REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers.  In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code.  Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn't benefitted from this kind of work until recently.  Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services.  We'll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss's RESTful Routing library.",

      "Description": "REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers.  In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code.  Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn't benefitted from this kind of work until recently.  Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services.  We'll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss's RESTful Routing library.",

Fubu (which stands for \"for us, by us\") focuses on rapid development, pluggability, and convention-based configuration. It tries to focus on SOLID principles, composability, separation of concerns, DRY, and other critical concepts of rapid, frictionless and pain-free web development. There are several differentiating features from ASP.NET MVC, such as behavior chains, packaging, routing conventions, HTML conventions, and much more.\r\n\r\nhttp://europevan.blogspot.com/2011/08/mike-murray-on-compositional-and.html",

      "Description": "REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers.  In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code.  Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn't benefitted from this kind of work until recently.  Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services.  We'll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss's RESTful Routing library.",

      "Description": "Mike Murray presenting at European Virtual Alt.NET on 20 Sept 2011.\r\n\r\nFubuMVC is a .NET open-source front-controller MVC web framework. Fubu (which stands for \"for us, by us\") focuses on rapid development, pluggability, and convention-based configuration. It tries to focus on SOLID principles, composability, separation of concerns, DRY, and other critical concepts of rapid, frictionless and pain-free web development. There are several differentiating features from ASP.NET MVC, such as behavior chains, packaging, routing conventions, HTML conventions, and much more.",

      "Description": "It&#39;s been WAY too long since we&#39;ve had Brian Beckman sharing knowledge, insights and perspectives on Channel 9. This changes now!  Needless to say, I was incredibly happy to spend an hour with Brian learning all about what he&#39;s up to these days. Not surprisingly, he&#39;s writing code and employing Rx&amp;nbsp;and monads to solve very interesting problems. In this conversation (a code lesson, algorithm survey, a splash&amp;nbsp;of random topical diversion), Brian explains and demonstrates his latest endeavor: implementing the Viterbi algorithm in C#. What&#39;s the Viterbi algorithm, Brian? What are hidden Markov models? What are you using this stuff for? Where does Rx fit into this? What&#39;s going on? By the way, it&#39;s awesome to&amp;nbsp;learn&amp;nbsp;that a Niner has been sharing C# monadic implementations with Brian (state monad, maybe monad). Of course, no conversation with Brian - a physicist by training and a software architect at Microsoft - is complete without talking about some current physics problem: Finding the elusive Higgs Boson is all the rage these days, so we talk about what it means. Brian also shares insights on Haskell, functional and hybrid programming languages (C# is imperative, but it provides functional capabilities like LINQ, for example, upon which Rx is built (Rx is LINQ-to-Streams or observable sequences of events, really)...). We also finally discuss&amp;nbsp;his previous work at MS that we never got a chance to talk to him about while&amp;nbsp;he was doing it. Before joining the Bing Mobile team, Brian was working on a project&amp;nbsp;to create a new functional programming language. What was it?

Attendees will learn how to effectively use the content pipeline, import 2D sprites into XNA, manage input from the keyboard, mouse, Xbox 360 controller and Zune, manage game state, and debug the resulting game. The sample code will be built on a PC and run on the PC, Xbox 360, and Zune platforms when complete.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGUEST PRESENTER: Brian Peek",

This video also give a basic introduction to entry to senior developers a much overlooked features of web application development process i.e., Optimization consideration.  This video talks about in particular why a response time or latency times are important for ASP.NET 4 pages, and what is meant by Scale Up and Scale OUT processes are.    This video introduces the fundamental concepts of where the need for Optimization is such as WebFarms/Gardens, SQL Server Replication and Dedicated Servers for Services for increasing Response, reducing Latency and Balancing Loads on web site.    Also introduces on how to implement ASP.NET 4 Configuration and Optimization techniques in .ASPX pages to achieve the objectives of implementing Optimization in a web site.  This 4 Part series (will be releasing shortly as a premium video series on www.dotnetvideos.net) covers a wide array of optimization techniques designed specifically to decrease request/response times of ASP.NET pages, reduce latency, and increase the perceived performance of the user interface. Optimization techniques may apply at your systems architecture, through your application configuration, within your application code, and even down to the resources your application utilizes.",

At the same time, MonoTouch.Dialog doesn't limit the ability to customize such applications. This video introduces MonoTouch.Dialog by way of an example that demonstrates how to create a master detail style of application. It shows how to use MonoTouch.Dialog to present hierarchies of information and use it to create table based user interfaces automatically.\n\nFor additional information be sure to check out these links:\n\nhttp://docs.xamarin.com/ios/tutorials/MonoTouch.Dialog \n\nhttps://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog",

      "Description": "Using MonoTouch.Dialog allows applications to be created with rich, table-based user interfaces, without all the complexities associated with creating such interfaces manually. At the same time, MonoTouch.Dialog doesn't limit the ability to customize such applications. This video introduces MonoTouch.Dialog by way of an example that demonstrates how to create a master detail style of application. It shows how to use MonoTouch.Dialog to present hierarchies of information and use it to create table based user interfaces automatically.\r\n\r\nFor additional information be sure to check out these links:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.xamarin.com/ios/tutorials/MonoTouch.Dialog \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog",

All identities in .NET are now modeled using the claims-based paradigm, and token based authentication (which is also the basis for federation) is now a first class citizen in the framework. This has been achieved by tightly integrating the Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) into the core class library. Since these changes have been made in the base classes, all application level frameworks like ASP.NET, WCF and WPF inherit these new features. Learn what these new mechanisms have to offer, what that means to existing applications and how you migrate either from stock .NET or WIF enabled applications.",

They were frustrated that so much ceremony and effort was going into so little success, in failed project after failed project, across the software industry.   \r\n  \r\nThey had each enjoyed amazing successes in their own right, and realised their approaches were more similar than different, so they met to agree on a common set of principles. Which we promptly abandoned. The problem is that Agile calls for us to embrace uncertainty, and we are desperately uncomfortable with uncertainty. So much so that we will replace it with anything, even things we know don’t work. We really do prefer the Devil we know.  \r\n  \r\nOver the last year or so Dan has been studying and talking about patterns of effective software delivery. In this talk he explains why Embracing Uncertainty is the most fundamental effectiveness pattern of all, and offers advice to help make uncertainty less scary. He is pretty sure he won’t succeed.",

      "Description": "Before the web, software developers implemented what we now refer to as desktop applications, using powerful graphics APIs that gave them the ability to program pretty much anything they could imagine. Then along came browsers with virtually no standard graphics support at all. Enter boring web applications, and dull work for developers.  \r\nBut now, with HTML5 Canvas, developers have a powerful graphics API that lets them develop mind-blowing applications. Now you can implement desktop-like applications that run in a browser. Tonight, we'll see how.  \r\nThis talk is a demo-fueled, fast-paced introduction to HTML5 Canvas. You'll get an overview of the Canvas API, and see how you can use it to draw, manipulate images, and implement sprite-based animation. You will get a feel for what you can do with this powerful API, and you'll get a basic understanding of how to harness that power.",

      "Description": "Video games are fun to play, but they are much more fun to develop. Taking an idea for a game to fruition in the browser is one of the most gratifying experiences for a software developer. And it makes testing the best part of your day.  \r\nIn this talk, you'll see how to implement a game using HTML5 APIs such as Canvas, Audio, and Local Storage. With the Canvas API you can implement static games, such as board games or puzzles, with relative ease. But in this talk, we'll tackle the more difficult realm of the game spectrum by looking at the implementation of a full-blown arcade game, complete with smooth animation, sprites, and yes, explosions.  \r\nWe will cover a great deal of ground in this demo-fueled overview of game development, including:  \r\n-   Animation with the Canvas API  \r\n-   Scrolling backgrounds  \r\n-   Implementing sprites  \r\n-   Developing a behavior-based game framework  \r\n-   Collision detection  \r\n-   Using sounds  \r\n-   Improving performance through timelines and profiling  \r\n-   Implementing controls, such as scoreboards",

      "Description": "Already back in 1999 some smart guys came around predicting that mobile would have been the primary focus of development in only a few years. It actually took a bit more than expected but the era of mobile software arrived at last. Why did it take so long? The answer is surprisingly simple: mobile software needed a critical mass of users to take off. The process of users aggregation started probably with the release of the first iPhone back in 2007 but has today a mass large enough to trigger any sort of chain reactions. Back in 1990 (yes, you read it right) Bill Gates gave a keynote talk at Comdex titled “information at your fingertips”. Let’s be honest, for twenty years we pretended we really had information (we needed) at our fingertips. To stay with the paraphrase, at most we had information at hand; not certainly at fingertips. Now it’s the time, though. With devices everywhere, and especially with a revolutionary Windows coming up,  I believe we’re really entering a new era of development—device computing. Device computing is about smart software that understands the device it is running on and intelligently adapts to the user that holds the device. Smart software is inevitably user-centered: where the user is, what the user may be doing, what the user likes, what the user may need. Developing mobile software is overall simple—no matter the myriad of SDKs and languages. The hardest part is finding proper user stories and deriving adequate use-cases from them. Sounds like a deja-vu? Maybe the idea is nothing new; but we never wrote software like this and this is the only software we may be called to write in five years.",

All this makes writing a mobile application a different type of challenge and requires a different set of design patterns. In this talk, we’ll identify a few common patterns that can be applied to any mobile platforms although, perhaps through a different API. We’ll talk about usability solutions, predictive fetch of data, input minimization and guesswork, connectivity issues, storage of sensitive data and more.",

      "Description": "When building modern applications, you have many security options. How do you authenticate, how do you authorize? How do you manage access to resources on behalf of your users? Do you have to integrate with corporate security systems, or do you want to support web identities like a Google ID? Which protocols do your customers support? How do you provision new users and grant access? You can build such systems on your own and take the risk of getting sucked into a complexity vortex while doing so. Or you use a third party service to encapsulate the technical details into a service that you simply use from your applications. Such a service is the Windows Azure Access Control Service. It provides security services to applications - in the cloud, on-premise or wherever you want. This talk explains what ACS is all about and how it works.",

Dropping the Sprint timebox can seem quite scary but on the other hand spending less time planning and estimating seems attractive to many developers. How do you know that you haven't thrown the baby out with the bathwater?   \r\nCome to this talk to hear about what Kanban can bring your team and what practical steps you take to get started and keep going through the rough patches. We also take a look at potential pitfalls with Kanban and situations where you might want to move back to vanilla Scrum.

It also holds a powerful secret: it also has extensions that allow it to compile native C# source files as if they were originally written in Nemerle.  \r\n  \r\nOver the course of an hour, we will explore using Nemerle's rich macro syntax to add language features to the C# language by using the power of the Nemerle compiler, and unlike Roslyn, Nemerle's metaprogramming features are available for use today in production environments.

      "Description": "Many teams who are already using Scrum would like to know what benefits they can get by moving to Kanban. Dropping the Sprint timebox can seem quite scary but on the other hand spending less time planning and estimating seems attractive to many developers. How do you know that you haven't thrown the baby out with the bathwater?   \r\nCome to this talk to hear about what Kanban can bring your team and what practical steps you take to get started and keep going through the rough patches. We also take a look at potential pitfalls with Kanban and situations where you might want to move back to vanilla Scrum. I'll illustrate this talk with some stories from teams I've been coaching at BBC and Deutsche Bank.",

      "Description": "The Agile movement shifted the relationship between clients and developers in a profound way.  In waterfall processes, clients specified large amounts of functionality, then nervously faded into the background until the fateful day-of-delivery.  With Agile, developers strove to engage with clients continuously, and delivered much more frequently against their needs.   A new trust was established.  \r\nAt the Forward Internet Group in London, we are implementing a second major shift between clients and developers.  The trust of the clients in developers evolves into a broader trust of the developers to deliver business value without resorting to a series of well-defined stories.  In essence, the business has empowered the developers to do what they think is right for the business.  This model, popularized by Facebook, has several labels, but the one we prefer for our flavor is Programmer Anarchy.  \r\nWe will start with stock Agile, and begin to apply environmental factors that led us to drop “standard” Agile practices.  We will also watch as well-defined Agile roles evaporate completely as other environmental factors are applied.  Finally, we will arrive at Programmer Anarchy, an organization often following none of the standard Agile practices, having no BA or QA roles, and even missing any managers of programmers.  \r\nWe will summarize our environmental factors, and postulate on the required and optional factors. We will make bold, controversial assertions.  We will back up these assertions with actual experiences.  \r\nProgrammer Anarchy has garnered rave reviews at every conference venue, and is provoking the intended debate on our current Agile thinking.  \r\nTarget Audience Agile-Lean practitioners who are feeling the \"warts\" in their implementations; programmers and project managers",

With that comes WebSocket, which exposes a very basic channel of bi-directional communication with little overhead. WebSocket enables the transmission of data in real time faster and easier than ever before.  \r\n  \r\nProjects like Socket.IO, subject of this talk, have been working hard on bringing this API to everyone, in the same way jQuery did for the DOM and AJAX. Not only do we make WebSocket ready for real-world usage, but it comes with fallbacks for every browser.  \r\n  \r\nThis talk will explore the creation and deployment of a realtime application the audience can interact with from their laptops and mobile devices. Oh, and it will work on IE!",

      "Description": "In the last years, I've met several project teams doing SpecFlow testing. For almost all of them the biggest challenge was to improve the efficiency of the automated testing process. Typical questions are about organizing feature files, keeping the specification language consistent, refactoring feature files, automation code maintainability, better feedback from failing tests, test execution time or handling stability issues. Some people were asking me if BDD/SpecFlow scales well for projects beyond BookShop? (It does.)  \r\n  \r\nEvery project is different, so their problems are. Still, I have collected a handful ideas that make sense to consider. In this session I would like to show you some of these, through examples from real projects wherever it is possible. You will see in detail the application of the page object pattern, the organization of Ghekin files to a feature tree and also the different ways of applying the default value pattern. These ideas are shown in scope of .NET and SpecFlow, but also applicable to automated testing solutions in other fields.",

ASP.NET MVC offers us great potential to create ReST architectures that can be consumed by computers and humans alike, reducing the amount of effort involved.

      "Description": "Every web developer encounter in their work the need to see what goes on \"in the wire\", whether it is an AJAX call in ASP.NET, a WCF service call from Silverlight, or a simple postback for an ASP.NET web page. With Fiddler, the most famous HTTP sniffer, this is simple enough to do. Fiddler is more than just a sniffer; with Fiddler you can intercept, alter, and record messages. You can even write your own visualizers that display the content of the messages according to its meaning (video, image, XML, JSON …).In this session we will learn how to use Fiddler from bottom to top to make our debugging routine easier.",

In this sessions Jonas will share lessons learned while porting the game, and showcase how the game takes advantage of the various unique features of each platform.  \r\n  \r\nThe sessions will cover a range of topics such as; how to port an iOS designed application to the Metro design language, why taking advantage of Live Tiles is important, how to use operating system features such as Charms, Lock Screen Apps, Launchers & Choosers and more.  \r\n  \r\nThe session will also cover the more technical aspects of architecting an application for maximum code reuse across Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8. Jonas will demonstrate 4 different techniques for enabling reuse of code.",

      "Description": "Topic for this presentation is intercultural communication in agile distributed teams  \r\n  \r\nThis 60 min talk will get into how and what online gaming can teach distributed/offshore teams on how to improve their online communication habits and work efficiency. In all types of communication, something gets lost or modified between the sender and the receiver. As projects move in to critical or stressful times, layers of messages will call for the team (and team managers) to stay sharp and to ensure that time isn’t wasted on “too much talk and too little progress”. A lot can be said about intercultural communication. And there’s a lot to be learned from it when working in cross cultural teams. Teams which are separated by boarders, languages, cultures, and backgrounds have more complex challenges compared to local teams. They need to respond quicker and meet expectations in a cultural setting that might be vague or unfamiliar for them. Switching between communication tools and formal/ informal ways of addressing issues will affect the message, and thus can affect the outcome. In this talk, by taking examples from online gamers, I will give the audience useful guidelines and advice on how to create a strategy for their teams when using tools such as IM and email in their distributed projects. I will also talk about the role of the manager in these distributed teams, as many teams are completely virtual and never meet in person. The virtual leader could also learn tactics from how a virtual Battlefield commandor or squad leader tactically gets his/hers squad through missions.",

      "Description": "Topic for this presentation is intercultural communication in agile distributed teams  \r\n  \r\nThis 60 min talk will get into how and what online gaming can teach distributed/offshore teams on how to improve their online communication habits and work efficiency. In all types of communication, something gets lost or modified between the sender and the receiver. As projects move in to critical or stressful times, layers of messages will call for the team (and team managers) to stay sharp and to ensure that time isn’t wasted on “too much talk and too little progress”. A lot can be said about intercultural communication. And there’s a lot to be learned from it when working in cross cultural teams. Teams which are separated by boarders, languages, cultures, and backgrounds have more complex challenges compared to local teams. They need to respond quicker and meet expectations in a cultural setting that might be vague or unfamiliar for them. Switching between communication tools and formal/ informal ways of addressing issues will affect the message, and thus can affect the outcome. In this talk, by taking examples from online gamers, I will give the audience useful guidelines and advice on how to create a strategy for their teams when using tools such as IM and email in their distributed projects. I will also talk about the role of the manager in these distributed teams, as many teams are completely virtual and never meet in person. The virtual leader could also learn tactics from how a virtual Battlefield commandor or squad leader tactically gets his/hers squad through missions.",

      "Description": "C# (or Java) developers looking to cut down amount of repetitive boilerplate code but wary to let go of safe harbour of compile time checking  \r\n  \r\nApproach of incorporating conventions to cut down on repetitive boilerplate code has been around for several years. How can we apply this approach in a staticaly typed language, like C#, to best leverage its strenghts while retaining benefits of the language and .NET plaftorm?  \r\n  \r\nThis talk will push the boundaries of your knowledge about using conventions. You will learn how to properly apply the aproach to dramatically cut down on the code no-one wants to write, and how to build application specific \"compiler\" to validate your conventions.

Here too, the MVVM pattern is making developers' life easier, and proven components can be used to simplify and speed up application development. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, the creator of the acclaimed MVVM Light Toolkit, will present best practices around XAML-based Windows 8 application development, and how to leverage code and skills in Windows 8 too.",

      "Description": "We've seen a sea change in the industry recently.  More and more applications are being written in dynamically typed languages like Javascript and Ruby.  Theoretically, this is progress.  But, what happens when they go bad?  What are the recovery options.  In this talk, we will explore methods for making sense of, and recovering large legacy code bases in dynamically type languages.  We'll concentrate on the differences between them and their statically-typed counterparts.",

When Microsoft set out to design WPF, Silverlight, and now WinRT XAML Apps, they architected it in a way that if you come across anything that they didn’t think of, you can extend the platform yourself. In this session I’ll show you how to develop two types of behaviors as well as your own markup extensions. Behaviors are elements that you set to something in order to add characteristics and functionality to XAML, while markup extensions are what you set properties to. The {Binding} markup extension is one that Microsoft provided for you, now come learn how to write your own, even if it’s to simply standardize on repetitive binding settings.",

We will look at how a new team can forecast velocity by looking at other teams. We will see how to predict the velocity of a team that will grow or shrink in size. Most importantly we will look at the use of confidence intervals to create plans we can be 90% confident in, even on fixed-price or fixed-date contracts.",

      "Description": "Velocity is perhaps the most useful metric available to agile teams. In this session we will look at advanced uses of velocity for planning under special but common circumstances. We will see how to forecast velocity in the complete absence of any historical data. We will look at how a new team can forecast velocity by looking at other teams. We will see how to predict the velocity of a team that will grow or shrink in size. Most importantly we will look at the use of confidence intervals to create plans we can be 90% confident in, even on fixed-price or fixed-date contracts.",

      "Description": "One of the challenges of agile development is coming to grips with the role of leaders and managers of self-organizing teams. Many would-be ScrumMasters and agile coaches go to the extreme of refusing to exert any influence on their teams at all. Others retain too much of their prior command-and-control management styles and fail to unleash the creativity and productivity of a self-organizing team.  \r\n  \r\nLeading a self-organizing team can be a fine line. In this session you will learn the proper ways to influence the path taken by a team to solving the problems given to it. You will learn how to become comfortable in this role. You’ll understand why influencing a self-organizing team is neither sneaky nor inappropriate but is necessary.  \r\n  \r\nDrawing on analogies from fields such as evolutionary biology and the study of complex adaptive systems, the instructor will describe three factors necessary for self-organization to occur and then provide seven tools for guiding the direction taken by the team as they self-organize.",

However, in the years since the Agile Manifesto, the increasing popularity of agile and the dramatic improvements it brings has pushed it onto larger and larger projects. Additionally, having an entire team--especially on a large project--in one room, or even one building is a luxury no longer enjoyed by many projects.In this presentation, we will look at how agile can be scaled to work on any multi-team project. Even a project with two teams will benefit from learning how to proactively manage interteam dependencies, conduct iteration planning for multiple teams, cultivate communities of practice, and coordinating work. Because so many projects are spread across multiple sites we will also look at overcoming the unique challenges facing distributed teams. We will look at deciding how to distribute a team, how to create coherence among team members, the importance of getting together and when are the most important times to use the travel budget, changes to what the team documents, and how to handle meetings when spread across timezones. Whether your project is spread across two locations in the same city or spread around the globe, you will leave with practical advice to try tomorrow.",

The class will describe the six attributes that good stories should exhibit and present thirteen guidelines for writing better stories. We will explore how user role modeling can help when gathering a project’s initial stories.  \r\n  \r\nBecause requirements touch all job functions on a development project, this tutorial will be equally suited for analysts, customers, testers, programmers, managers, or anyone involved in a software development project. By the end of this tutorial, you will leave knowing the six attributes of a good story, learn a good format for writing most user stories, learn practical techniques for gathering user stories, know how much work to do up-front and how much to do just-in-time.",

      "Description": "Continuous Delivery is the process of having a shippable product after each check-in to the source control repository. Continuous Delivery is usually implemented as a natural improvement of a Continuous Integration process. This presentation highlights challenges and presents hints on how to start from a raw environment and incrementally build a successful deployment pipeline based on Team Foundation Server (TFS), providing substantial added-value for business. This presentation will describe the process of establishing Continuous Delivery in a project for FIFA. We describe the starting point, what we achieve in the first phases and what are the plans for further improvements in order to deliver high quality software in schedules defined by business needs – not by process and technology constraints. Making Waves took over as a Services Provider for the development and maintenance of FIFA's Intranet and Extranet platform in 2011. The main challenge was to avoid long release cycles, improve quality and provide a reliable hotfix strategy for urgent issues raised in production. The first phase of the project was focused on taking over the source code, development, test and production environments. This was a challenging task, mostly because of a lack of automation in build and deployment processes. This part of the presentation will cover possible approaches for how to incrementally create a flexible development environment, supported by a continuous integration process, in a legacy project inherited from an external part. The goal of the second project phase was to implement a continuous delivery process in the project. We will present the main arguments for investing in tools and processes which enable more frequent and automated releases, and how that brings significant business value. We will also cover how we implemented a set of practices and principles aimed at building, testing and releasing software faster and more frequently, including (but not limited to): deployment automation, release repository, production configuration tracking and version promotion between environments. The presentation will briefly cover tools which were used, including Team Foundation Server (TFS), but most of the content is technology agnostic and is relevant for both developers and more-business oriented people.",

      "Description": "Continuous Delivery is the process of having a shippable product after each check-in to the source control repository. Continuous Delivery is usually implemented as a natural improvement of a Continuous Integration process. This presentation highlights challenges and presents hints on how to start from a raw environment and incrementally build a successful deployment pipeline based on Team Foundation Server (TFS), providing substantial added-value for business. This presentation will describe the process of establishing Continuous Delivery in a project for FIFA. We describe the starting point, what we achieve in the first phases and what are the plans for further improvements in order to deliver high quality software in schedules defined by business needs – not by process and technology constraints. Making Waves took over as a Services Provider for the development and maintenance of FIFA's Intranet and Extranet platform in 2011. The main challenge was to avoid long release cycles, improve quality and provide a reliable hotfix strategy for urgent issues raised in production. The first phase of the project was focused on taking over the source code, development, test and production environments. This was a challenging task, mostly because of a lack of automation in build and deployment processes. This part of the presentation will cover possible approaches for how to incrementally create a flexible development environment, supported by a continuous integration process, in a legacy project inherited from an external part. The goal of the second project phase was to implement a continuous delivery process in the project. We will present the main arguments for investing in tools and processes which enable more frequent and automated releases, and how that brings significant business value. We will also cover how we implemented a set of practices and principles aimed at building, testing and releasing software faster and more frequently, including (but not limited to): deployment automation, release repository, production configuration tracking and version promotion between environments. The presentation will briefly cover tools which were used, including Team Foundation Server (TFS), but most of the content is technology agnostic and is relevant for both developers and more-business oriented people.",

      "Description": "Cloud Computing give users access to large pools of resources on demand with a utility  price  model  and  thereby  introduce  the  ability  for  developers  to  affect operational cost of an application. However, this ability is yet to be fully understood. In my master thesis I investigated the price models of several Cloud Computing providers, and described several ways to think about scalability and cost efficiency when designing and programming Cloud Computing applications. The presentation will focus on how to turn the mindset of the programmer to encompass the new responsibility of operational cost efficiency.",

      "Description": "The Windows Azure Service Bus is designed to provide connectivity, queuing, and routing capabilities not only for the cloud applications but also for on-premises applications. Microsoft BizTalk Server enables organizations to connect and extend heterogeneous systems across the enterprise and with trading partners. Using both together enables a significant number of scenarios in which you can build secure, reliable and scalable hybrid solutions that span the cloud and on premises environments. In this session you will see how to integrate these technologies to build secure, reliable and scalable hybrid solutions that span the cloud and on premises environments. During the session, I'll also demonstrate how to integrate a WF workflow service with the Service Bus. Objectives: 1. integrate the AppFabric Service Bus with existing and new BizTalk Server applications. 2. Integrate the AppFabric Service Bus with a WF workflow service. 3. Build a .NET application that exchanges messages via Service Bus topics and queues using WCF and the NetMessagingBinding.",

They were frustrated that so much ceremony and effort was going into so little success, in failed project after failed project, across the software industry.   \r\n  \r\nThey had each enjoyed amazing successes in their own right, and realised their approaches were more similar than different, so they met to agree on a common set of principles. Which we promptly abandoned. The problem is that Agile calls for us to embrace uncertainty, and we are desperately uncomfortable with uncertainty. So much so that we will replace it with anything, even things we know don’t work. We really do prefer the Devil we know.  \r\n  \r\nOver the last year or so Dan has been studying and talking about patterns of effective software delivery. In this talk he explains why Embracing Uncertainty is the most fundamental effectiveness pattern of all, and offers advice to help make uncertainty less scary. He is pretty sure he won’t succeed.",

      "Description": "At iPaper we had a not too uncommon problem - growth that was tough to keep up with using traditional hosting. Just moving everything to the cloud wasn't an option since we already had a large system running, and not everything fit the Cloud options available.  \r\n  \r\nIn this session I will walk you through how we moved terabytes of image data onto Amazon S3, while still running our systems at a local colo datacenter. Once on S3, we had strict requirements for maintaining local control of securing the data, while still serving it directly from the cloud. I'll demonstrate how we coupled the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network with S3 to serve data in a secure and highly performant fashion, fully controlled and secured by our own colo hosted systems.",

      "Title": "Fred George - Programmer Anarchy",
      "Description": "The Agile movement shifted the relationship between clients and developers in a profound way.  In waterfall processes, clients specified large amounts of functionality, then nervously faded into the background until the fateful day-of-delivery.  With Agile, developers strove to engage with clients continuously, and delivered much more frequently against their needs.   A new trust was established.  \r\nAt the Forward Internet Group in London, we are implementing a second major shift between clients and developers.  The trust of the clients in developers evolves into a broader trust of the developers to deliver business value without resorting to a series of well-defined stories.  In essence, the business has empowered the developers to do what they think is right for the business.  This model, popularized by Facebook, has several labels, but the one we prefer for our flavor is Programmer Anarchy.  \r\nWe will start with stock Agile, and begin to apply environmental factors that led us to drop “standard” Agile practices.  We will also watch as well-defined Agile roles evaporate completely as other environmental factors are applied.  Finally, we will arrive at Programmer Anarchy, an organization often following none of the standard Agile practices, having no BA or QA roles, and even missing any managers of programmers.  \r\nWe will summarize our environmental factors, and postulate on the required and optional factors. We will make bold, controversial assertions.  We will back up these assertions with actual experiences.  \r\nProgrammer Anarchy has garnered rave reviews at every conference venue, and is provoking the intended debate on our current Agile thinking.  \r\nTarget Audience Agile-Lean practitioners who are feeling the \"warts\" in their implementations; programmers and project managers",

With that comes WebSocket, which exposes a very basic channel of bi-directional communication with little overhead. WebSocket enables the transmission of data in real time faster and easier than ever before.  \r\n  \r\nProjects like Socket.IO, subject of this talk, have been working hard on bringing this API to everyone, in the same way jQuery did for the DOM and AJAX. Not only do we make WebSocket ready for real-world usage, but it comes with fallbacks for every browser.  \r\n  \r\nThis talk will explore the creation and deployment of a realtime application the audience can interact with from their laptops and mobile devices. Oh, and it will work on IE!",

However, this ability is yet to be fully understood. In my master thesis I investigated the price models of several Cloud Computing providers, and described several ways to think about scalability and cost efficiency when designing and programming Cloud Computing applications. The presentation will focus on how to turn the mindset of the programmer to encompass the new responsibility of operational cost efficiency.",

      "Description": "The Windows Azure Service Bus is designed to provide connectivity, queuing, and routing capabilities not only for the cloud applications but also for on-premises applications. Microsoft BizTalk Server enables organizations to connect and extend heterogeneous systems across the enterprise and with trading partners. Using both together enables a significant number of scenarios in which you can build secure, reliable and scalable hybrid solutions that span the cloud and on premises environments. In this session you will see how to integrate these technologies to build secure, reliable and scalable hybrid solutions that span the cloud and on premises environments. During the session, I'll also demonstrate how to integrate a WF workflow service with the Service Bus. Objectives: 1. integrate the AppFabric Service Bus with existing and new BizTalk Server applications. 2. Integrate the AppFabric Service Bus with a WF workflow service. 3. Build a .NET application that exchanges messages via Service Bus topics and queues using WCF and the NetMessagingBinding.",

Martin Fowler's Refactoring book was a great introductory book on how to clean up legacy code bases, but over the years, what I have found missing in that book is one a set of guidelines that links all the different types of refactoring techniques together into one continuous process. In this talk, I will show you how to take almost any code base, and refactor everything from the simplest nested' 'if' blocks all the way to extracting an actual domain/object model to using an IOC container framework., Using a set of repeatable steps, I will show you how easy it is to refactor almost any code base, even if you don't understand every part of the application.  \r\nOutline  \r\nIntroduction  \r\nAccidental vs Essential Complexity  \r\nEssential Complexity as a design tool  \r\nChipping away accidental complexity to reveal the actual design  \r\nBlind Refactoring in Ten Easy Steps  \r\nFlattening nested if blocks  \r\nMethod extractions  \r\nClass extractions  \r\nThe art of delegation  \r\nBreaking the dependencies  \r\nRecursive refactoring  \r\nThe tradeoffs of class decomposition vs inheritance, and how you can fix it  \r\nPutting the pieces back together again / dealing with ravioli code  \r\nThe magic composition abilities of an IOC container  \r\nThe different flavors of IOC containers in .NET",

      "Description": "You can't have a conversation about web technologies these days without someone dropping a mention of NodeJS and web sockets. If you're a .NET developer, someone will then reference SignalR with ASP.NET Web Pages or MVC. But what are these things? Which one is better? What do they do and how do they work? In this special \"Cage Match\" Rob Conery puts NodeJS up against Damian Edwards and SignalR - showing you the two technologies side by side in a bit of a tongue-in-cheek challenge.",

We start our journey in the late 80s and our \"discovery\" of design principles such as The Open Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle. In the middle 90s, we discovered that these principle led to repeating patterns of design. We gave those patterns names such as Visitor and Decorator. At the turn of the millennium we found that the benefits gained from the principles and patterns could be amplified by combining them with practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. And now, as the decade is coming to a close, we have found that these principles, patterns, and practices have driven us to define a true profession. What will that profession require of us, and who among us can truly claim to be professional?",

      "Description": "A tiny subset of your users can’t login: they get no error message yet have both cookies and JavaScript enabled. They’ve phoned up to report the problem and aren’t capable of getting a Fiddler trace. You’re serving a million hits a day. How do you trace their requests and determine the problem without drowning in logs?   \r\n  \r\nMarketing have requested that the new site section your team has built goes live at the same time as a radio campaign kicks off. This needs to happen simultaneously across all 40 front-end web servers, and you don’t want to break your regular deployment cadence while the campaign gets perpetually delayed. How do you do it?  \r\n  \r\nUsers are experiencing 500 errors for a few underlying reasons, some with workarounds and some without. The customer service call centre need to be able to rapidly triage incoming calls and provide the appropriate workaround where possible, without displaying sensitive exception detail to end users or requiring synchronous logging. At the same time, your team needs to prioritize which bugs to fix first. What’s the right balance of logging, error numbers and correlations ids?  \r\n  \r\nThese are all real scenarios that Tatham Oddie and his fellow consultants have solved on large scale, public websites. The lessons though are applicable to websites of all sizes and audiences.  \r\n  \r\nThe talk will be divided between each of the three scenarios described here, and then stuffed full of other tidbits of information throughout.",

      "Description": "This year, a small team of developers delivered a ASP.NET MVC app, with a Neo4j backed, all running in Azure. This isn't in POC; it's a production system. Also, unlike most graph DB talks, it's not a social network!  \r\nIn this session you'll hear the stories of:  \r\n- what our project is, why we chose a graph db, how we modelled it to start with and how our model was wrong  \r\n- how we deploy neo4j in Azure  \r\n- how we diagnosed and fixed a performance problem that spanned the CLR, the JVM and Azure  \r\n- how we built our own Neo4j client for .NET, complete with a fluent interface and internal logic to serialize .NET - expressions into Groovy comparisons (It was only slightly scary.)",

The contracts take the form of preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants. Contracts act as checked documentation of your external and internal APIs. The contracts are used to improve testing via runtime checking, enable static contract verification, and documentation generation. In this talk, I ‘ll demonstrate Code Contracts and focus on the advances we have made in the static checker and new support for assisted code repair using the Roslyn CTP.",

The typical deploy in our industry is hard. Releases are few and changes are many. It's an uncontrolled, hazardous event that is typically followed by overtime, bugs, mistakes, reckless tuning, bug fixing, and lots of praying. It doesn't have to be that way.This presentation looks at six important aspects of software delivery ranging from politics to automation. It guides you through these aspects with simple principles and concrete advice that will make your delivery process more successful.",

      "Description": "Nygaard and Dahl invented Simula’s classes and objects to master complex problems. Alan Kay invented object orientation (OO) with its networks of communicating objects to facilitate simple and powerful mental models. His goal was to make computers and programming comprehensible to children of all ages. Mainstream programmers missed the importance of communication in Kay’s OO and misused the term. A better name for their approach is ‘class orientation’.I have extended Kay’s original OO with explicit concepts and code that specify how objects interact at runtime. With this new paradigm, Data-Context-Interaction (DCI), programmers reason about their code, new team members get quickly up to speed, maintainers lead a better and more productive life. The DCI Context is a new abstraction that supplements the ubiquitous class. While a class says everything about the inside of an object and nothing about the objects surrounding it, a DCI Context says everything about a network of communicating objects and nothing about their insides. The class is great for describing autonomous objects such as the domain objects in the Data part of DCI. The Context is great for describing how use cases are realized by networks of communicating objects. Communication is now a first-class citizen of programming.",

      "Description": "Architecture isn't just the static \"shape\" of your software. It's the set of decisions that define it, enabling — or inhibiting — change, evolution and improvement over time.   \r\n  \r\nIt is also the decisions about how you verify, deploy, version, manage and monitor an application. Each of these decisions is a trade-off: there are no Best Practises. Some decisions can have a huge forward impact, and it isn't always obvious which ones!In this talk Dan offers several strategies to help you improve your architecture decision-making. He won't tell you whether to prefer stability or uncertainty, DRYness or coupling, latency or throughput, manual or automated testing.   \r\n  \r\nThat's up to you. But he might help you go into those decisions with your eyes open.",

This first part of four part series on ASP.NET 4 Optimization Techniques series on http://www.dotnetvideos.net web site would discuss what Optimization means in an ASP.NET web application context.  \r\n\r\nThis video also give a basic introduction to entry to senior developers a much overlooked features of web application development process i.e., Optimization consideration.  \r\n\r\nThis video talks about in particular why a response time or latency times are important for ASP.NET 4 pages, and what is meant by Scale Up and Scale OUT processes are.    \r\n\r\nThis video introduces the fundamental concepts of where the need for Optimization is such as WebFarms/Gardens, SQL Server Replication and Dedicated Servers for Services for increasing Response, reducing Latency and Balancing Loads on web site. Also introduces on how to implement ASP.NET 4 Configuration and Optimization techniques in .ASPX pages to achieve the objectives of implementing Optimization in a web site. \r\n\r\nThis 4 Part series (will be releasing shortly as a premium video series on www.dotnetvideos.net) covers a wide array of optimization techniques designed specifically to decrease request/response times of ASP.NET pages, reduce latency, and increase the perceived performance of the user interface. Optimization techniques may apply at your systems architecture, through your application configuration, within your application code, and even down to the resources your application utilizes.",

Join Udi for a new perspective on CQRS using a new twist on the saga pattern.",

In this talk, I ‘ll demonstrate Code Contracts and focus on the advances we have made in the static checker and new support for assisted code repair using the Roslyn CTP.",

      "Description": "The technique of expressing requirements as user stories is one of the most broadly applicable techniques introduced by the agile processes. User stories are an effective approach on all time constrained projects and are a great way to begin introducing a bit of agility to your projects.In this session, we will look at how to identify and write good user stories. The class will describe the six attributes that good stories should exhibit and present thirteen guidelines for writing better stories. We will explore how user role modeling can help when gathering a project’s initial stories.  \r\n  \r\nBecause requirements touch all job functions on a development project, this tutorial will be equally suited for analysts, customers, testers, programmers, managers, or anyone involved in a software development project. By the end of this tutorial, you will leave knowing the six attributes of a good story, learn a good format for writing most user stories, learn practical techniques for gathering user stories, know how much work to do up-front and how much to do just-in-time.",

      "Description": "One of the things I’ve always said about WPF is that there is nothing I can’t do in an application. When Microsoft set out to design WPF, Silverlight, and now WinRT XAML Apps, they architected it in a way that if you come across anything that they didn’t think of, you can extend the platform yourself. In this session I’ll show you how to develop two types of behaviors as well as your own markup extensions. Behaviors are elements that you set to something in order to add characteristics and functionality to XAML, while markup extensions are what you set properties to. The {Binding} markup extension is one that Microsoft provided for you, now come learn how to write your own, even if it’s to simply standardize on repetitive binding settings.",

In this session, I will walk you through the internal storage format of MDF files, how we might go about parsing a complete database ourselves, using nothing but a hex editor.  \r\n  \r\nI will cover how SQL Server stores its own internal metadata about objects, how it knows where to find your data on disk, and once it finds it, how to read it. Using the knowledge from this session, you'll get a solid understanding of the basics behind SQL Server storage.",

With Fiddler, the most famous HTTP sniffer, this is simple enough to do. Fiddler is more than just a sniffer; with Fiddler you can intercept, alter, and record messages. You can even write your own visualizers that display the content of the messages according to its meaning (video, image, XML, JSON …).In this session we will learn how to use Fiddler from bottom to top to make our debugging routine easier.",

Neuroscience is no longer confined the realm of huge research budgets and professors in lab coats. It is accessible to regular developers. This session illustrates a neuroheadset that reads brain waves and uses a C# API to allow developers to recognise facial expressions, emotions and cognitive thought – that is, the headset can read basic, deliberate conscious thought. Although the headset is aimed at the gaming market the potential for the physically impaired is considerable. Come and see the potential of today’s Brain Computer Interfaces.",

      "Description": "I Can't Believe It's Not Roslyn--Using Nemerle Macros to extend the C# Language  \r\n  \r\nNemerle is a powerful .NET language that allows its users to extend its syntax and add new language features to suit their target domains. It also holds a powerful secret: it also has extensions that allow it to compile native C# source files as if they were originally written in Nemerle.  \r\n  \r\nOver the course of an hour, we will explore using Nemerle's rich macro syntax to add language features to the C# language by using the power of the Nemerle compiler, and unlike Roslyn, Nemerle's metaprogramming features are available for use today in production environments. This is one mind-bending session that you won't want to miss!",

All this makes writing a mobile application a different type of challenge and requires a different set of design patterns. In this talk, we’ll identify a few common patterns that can be applied to any mobile platforms although, perhaps through a different API. We’ll talk about usability solutions, predictive fetch of data, input minimization and guesswork, connectivity issues, storage of sensitive data and more.",

Taking an idea for a game to fruition in the browser is one of the most gratifying experiences for a software developer. And it makes testing the best part of your day.  \r\nIn this talk, you'll see how to implement a game using HTML5 APIs such as Canvas, Audio, and Local Storage. With the Canvas API you can implement static games, such as board games or puzzles, with relative ease. But in this talk, we'll tackle the more difficult realm of the game spectrum by looking at the implementation of a full-blown arcade game, complete with smooth animation, sprites, and yes, explosions.  \r\nWe will cover a great deal of ground in this demo-fueled overview of game development, including:  \r\n-   Animation with the Canvas API  \r\n-   Scrolling backgrounds  \r\n-   Implementing sprites  \r\n-   Developing a behavior-based game framework  \r\n-   Collision detection  \r\n-   Using sounds  \r\n-   Improving performance through timelines and profiling  \r\n-   Implementing controls, such as scoreboards",

Then along came browsers with virtually no standard graphics support at all. Enter boring web applications, and dull work for developers.  \r\nBut now, with HTML5 Canvas, developers have a powerful graphics API that lets them develop mind-blowing applications. Now you can implement desktop-like applications that run in a browser. Tonight, we'll see how.  \r\nThis talk is a demo-fueled, fast-paced introduction to HTML5 Canvas. You'll get an overview of the Canvas API, and see how you can use it to draw, manipulate images, and implement sprite-based animation. You will get a feel for what you can do with this powerful API, and you'll get a basic understanding of how to harness that power.",

All identities in .NET are now modeled using the claims-based paradigm, and token based authentication (which is also the basis for federation) is now a first class citizen in the framework. This has been achieved by tightly integrating the Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) into the core class library. Since these changes have been made in the base classes, all application level frameworks like ASP.NET, WCF and WPF inherit these new features. Learn what these new mechanisms have to offer, what that means to existing applications and how you migrate either from stock .NET or WIF enabled applications.",

      "Description": "Microsoft’s new framework for writing RESTful web services and web APIs is appropriately enough called ASP.NET Web API. As the name applies, this technology is part of ASP.NET and also inherits its well-known security architecture. But in addition it also supports a number of new extensibility points and a flexible hosting infrastructure outside of IIS. There are a number of ways how to do authentication and authorization in Web API - from Windows to usernames and passwords up to token based authentication and everything in between. This talk explores the various options, and puts special focus on technologies like claims, SAML, OAuth2, Simple Web Tokens and delegation.",

      "Description": "We’ve come a long way in the last 20 years. We start our journey in the late 80s and our \"discovery\" of design principles such as The Open Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle. In the middle 90s, we discovered that these principle led to repeating patterns of design. We gave those patterns names such as Visitor and Decorator. At the turn of the millennium we found that the benefits gained from the principles and patterns could be amplified by combining them with practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. And now, as the decade is coming to a close, we have found that these principles, patterns, and practices have driven us to define a true profession. What will that profession require of us, and who among us can truly claim to be professional?",

      "Description": "Some programmers are simply more effective than others. Kent Beck famously described himself as \"not a great programmer, but a good programmer with great habits.\"   \r\n  \r\nOver the last year or so I've been working with, and observing, some very good programmers with quite exceptional - and rather surprising - habits.Is there a better way than katas to learn a new language? Is copy-and-paste always evil? Should you always test-drive production code?   \r\n  \r\nIn this talk Dan introduces the idea of programming patterns - patterns of effective programming behaviour - and describes some of the more unusual but effective programming patterns he's collected over the last year.   \r\n  \r\nThese are not patterns for beginners, but then again, Dan argues that patterns aren't for beginners anyway.",

      "Description": "Already back in 1999 some smart guys came around predicting that mobile would have been the primary focus of development in only a few years. It actually took a bit more than expected but the era of mobile software arrived at last. Why did it take so long? The answer is surprisingly simple: mobile software needed a critical mass of users to take off. The process of users aggregation started probably with the release of the first iPhone back in 2007 but has today a mass large enough to trigger any sort of chain reactions. Back in 1990 (yes, you read it right) Bill Gates gave a keynote talk at Comdex titled “information at your fingertips”. Let’s be honest, for twenty years we pretended we really had information (we needed) at our fingertips. To stay with the paraphrase, at most we had information at hand; not certainly at fingertips. Now it’s the time, though. With devices everywhere, and especially with a revolutionary Windows coming up,  I believe we’re really entering a new era of development—device computing. Device computing is about smart software that understands the device it is running on and intelligently adapts to the user that holds the device. Smart software is inevitably user-centered: where the user is, what the user may be doing, what the user likes, what the user may need. Developing mobile software is overall simple—no matter the myriad of SDKs and languages. The hardest part is finding proper user stories and deriving adequate use-cases from them. Sounds like a deja-vu? Maybe the idea is nothing new; but we never wrote software like this and this is the only software we may be called to write in five years.",

      "Description": "When building modern applications, you have many security options. How do you authenticate, how do you authorize? How do you manage access to resources on behalf of your users? Do you have to integrate with corporate security systems, or do you want to support web identities like a Google ID? Which protocols do your customers support? How do you provision new users and grant access? You can build such systems on your own and take the risk of getting sucked into a complexity vortex while doing so. Or you use a third party service to encapsulate the technical details into a service that you simply use from your applications. Such a service is the Windows Azure Access Control Service. It provides security services to applications - in the cloud, on-premise or wherever you want. This talk explains what ACS is all about and how it works.",

With WinRT and the Metro-style applications, XAML is now a first-class citizen for native Windows 8 development. Here too, the MVVM pattern is making developers' life easier, and proven components can be used to simplify and speed up application development. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, the creator of the acclaimed MVVM Light Toolkit, will present best practices around XAML-based Windows 8 application development, and how to leverage code and skills in Windows 8 too.",

      "Description": "One of the challenges of agile development is coming to grips with the role of leaders and managers of self-organizing teams. Many would-be ScrumMasters and agile coaches go to the extreme of refusing to exert any influence on their teams at all. Others retain too much of their prior command-and-control management styles and fail to unleash the creativity and productivity of a self-organizing team.  \r\n  \r\nLeading a self-organizing team can be a fine line. In this session you will learn the proper ways to influence the path taken by a team to solving the problems given to it. You will learn how to become comfortable in this role. You’ll understand why influencing a self-organizing team is neither sneaky nor inappropriate but is necessary.  \r\n  \r\nDrawing on analogies from fields such as evolutionary biology and the study of complex adaptive systems, the instructor will describe three factors necessary for self-organization to occur and then provide seven tools for guiding the direction taken by the team as they self-organize.",

      "Description": "A tiny subset of your users can’t login: they get no error message yet have both cookies and JavaScript enabled. They’ve phoned up to report the problem and aren’t capable of getting a Fiddler trace. You’re serving a million hits a day. How do you trace their requests and determine the problem without drowning in logs?   \r\n  \r\nMarketing have requested that the new site section your team has built goes live at the same time as a radio campaign kicks off. This needs to happen simultaneously across all 40 front-end web servers, and you don’t want to break your regular deployment cadence while the campaign gets perpetually delayed. How do you do it?  \r\n  \r\nUsers are experiencing 500 errors for a few underlying reasons, some with workarounds and some without. The customer service call centre need to be able to rapidly triage incoming calls and provide the appropriate workaround where possible, without displaying sensitive exception detail to end users or requiring synchronous logging. At the same time, your team needs to prioritize which bugs to fix first. What’s the right balance of logging, error numbers and correlations ids?  \r\n  \r\nThese are all real scenarios that Tatham Oddie and his fellow consultants have solved on large scale, public websites. The lessons though are applicable to websites of all sizes and audiences.  \r\n  \r\nThe talk will be divided between each of the three scenarios described here, and then stuffed full of other tidbits of information throughout.",

This includes studying async methods which are part of C# 5.0 and build on the PFx Task library. We will also briefly look at the PFx Task libraries to gain the necessary background for working with the new language features. Note that Visual Basic 11 will also have these identical features so in essence we'll be covering VB 11 as well.",

In doing so, we can create robust and scalable applications, not only from a performance point of view but also in terms of change and maintainability. ASP.NET MVC offers us great potential to create ReST architectures that can be consumed by computers and humans alike, reducing the amount of effort involved. Now combined with the WCF Web API which is focused exclusively around ReSTful constraint, MVC offers us even more possibilities. Come to this session to learn what ReST is really about and how we can create simple yet powerful systems with the Microsoft MVC stack.",

Unfortunately there’s also a ton of horrible, twisted and somewhat convoluted code that would make any developer that remotely cares about clean code suicidal.  \r\n  \r\nA dynamic language that has somewhat given us a license to do anything we want has been abused to the point that much of the blame has been placed on the language itself as opposed to the developers. In this talk we’ll discuss some of the patterns and anti-patterns of JavaScript, things you should and shouldn’t do.

      "Description": "Nygaard and Dahl invented Simula’s classes and objects to master complex problems. Alan Kay invented object orientation (OO) with its networks of communicating objects to facilitate simple and powerful mental models. His goal was to make computers and programming comprehensible to children of all ages. Mainstream programmers missed the importance of communication in Kay’s OO and misused the term. A better name for their approach is ‘class orientation’.I have extended Kay’s original OO with explicit concepts and code that specify how objects interact at runtime. With this new paradigm, Data-Context-Interaction (DCI), programmers reason about their code, new team members get quickly up to speed, maintainers lead a better and more productive life. The DCI Context is a new abstraction that supplements the ubiquitous class. While a class says everything about the inside of an object and nothing about the objects surrounding it, a DCI Context says everything about a network of communicating objects and nothing about their insides. The class is great for describing autonomous objects such as the domain objects in the Data part of DCI. The Context is great for describing how use cases are realized by networks of communicating objects. Communication is now a first-class citizen of programming.",

Martin Fowler's Refactoring book was a great introductory book on how to clean up legacy code bases, but over the years, what I have found missing in that book is one a set of guidelines that links all the different types of refactoring techniques together into one continuous process. In this talk, I will show you how to take almost any code base, and refactor everything from the simplest nested' 'if' blocks all the way to extracting an actual domain/object model to using an IOC container framework., Using a set of repeatable steps, I will show you how easy it is to refactor almost any code base, even if you don't understand every part of the application.  \r\nOutline  \r\nIntroduction  \r\nAccidental vs Essential Complexity  \r\nEssential Complexity as a design tool  \r\nChipping away accidental complexity to reveal the actual design  \r\nBlind Refactoring in Ten Easy Steps  \r\nFlattening nested if blocks  \r\nMethod extractions  \r\nClass extractions  \r\nThe art of delegation  \r\nBreaking the dependencies  \r\nRecursive refactoring  \r\nThe tradeoffs of class decomposition vs inheritance, and how you can fix it  \r\nPutting the pieces back together again / dealing with ravioli code  \r\nThe magic composition abilities of an IOC container  \r\nThe different flavors of IOC containers in .NET",

But what exactly is WinRT and what does it enable developers to do? In this session, we’ll take a look at how WinRT is opening up Windows 8 to developers. We will cover several, more advanced topics using WinRT, including MVVM, file access, background tasks, push notifications, the async pattern and more.",

It will dig into the latest features for asynchronous programming in .NET  and examine some of the newest features of C# 5.0. This includes studying async methods which are part of C# 5.0 and build on the PFx Task library. We will also briefly look at the PFx Task libraries to gain the necessary background for working with the new language features. Note that Visual Basic 11 will also have these identical features so in essence we'll be covering VB 11 as well.",

Then this session is for you! We'll not only talk about what WebGL is, but go through a practical example of creating our first WebGL app, covering all the concepts from the process of allocating resources in Javascript to writing your own massively parallel code to execute on the GPU - all from the comfort of your favourite browser*. Don't worry if you've never done 3D graphics or maths before, this session will show you that you don't need to have existing knowledge in order to create wonderful things that even your non-techy friends will be able to appreciate and go \"ooh\" over.*Unless your favourite browser is IE, sorry!",

      "Description": "This year, a small team of developers delivered a ASP.NET MVC app, with a Neo4j backed, all running in Azure. This isn't in POC; it's a production system. Also, unlike most graph DB talks, it's not a social network!  \r\nIn this session you'll hear the stories of:  \r\n- what our project is, why we chose a graph db, how we modelled it to start with and how our model was wrong  \r\n- how we deploy neo4j in Azure  \r\n- how we diagnosed and fixed a performance problem that spanned the CLR, the JVM and Azure  \r\n- how we built our own Neo4j client for .NET, complete with a fluent interface and internal logic to serialize .NET - expressions into Groovy comparisons (It was only slightly scary.)",

Having set up an MVVM application and decided on using a repository pattern on the phone that mirrors the server's repository, Jon throws caution to the wind and gives it a shot.Some highlights:Moving to the repository pattern breaks the application workflow&nbsp;causes some interesting changes in how state is maintained Jon and Jesse decide it's time to start moving towards separate client and server databases with a sync process Jon writes&nbsp;&nbsp;a buggy save method and actually decides to write a failing unit test before fixing it \r\n\r\nNote: This episode was actually recorded in May and nearly got lost in the shuffle with MIX. We still think it's a good one since it explains where we're going with the client/server data storage, so here it is.",

Every week someone in the blogosphere is hyping a new methodology, or modifications to an existing one, all of which claim to be the next big thing. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of the methodologies that has outlasted its fad phase and has become a major player in the software development methodology arena. Once you have grasped the methodology there are numerous ways you can make the process easier in the .NET space. In this talk Keith will provide guidance on how to architect your code and solution structure to lend itself to unit testing.

This talk will share the knowledge the Halo Services Team gained while making the jump from SQL to Azure Storage while working on Halo 4. I'll start with an overview of the core differences between the two data stores. In addition I'll discuss the importance of partitions in Azure Table, and how to perform transactions. Finally I'll cover how to incorporate other data best practices, and explore how to achieve transaction like behavior across partitions using the Saga Pattern.",

      "Description": "Moving from storing your data in an RDBMS like SQL Server to a NoSQL data store like Azure Table requires a programming paradigm shift. This talk will share the knowledge the Halo Services Team gained while making the jump from SQL to Azure Storage while working on Halo 4. I'll start with an overview of the core differences between the two data stores. In addition I'll discuss the importance of partitions in Azure Table, and how to perform transactions. Finally I'll cover how to incorporate other data best practices, and explore how to achieve transaction like behavior across partitions using the Saga Pattern.",

      "Title": "Gáspár Nagy - Ideas for efficient BDD with SpecFlow through examples",
      "Description": "In the last years, I've met several project teams doing SpecFlow testing. For almost all of them the biggest challenge was to improve the efficiency of the automated testing process. Typical questions are about organizing feature files, keeping the specification language consistent, refactoring feature files, automation code maintainability, better feedback from failing tests, test execution time or handling stability issues. Some people were asking me if BDD/SpecFlow scales well for projects beyond BookShop? (It does.)  \r\n  \r\nEvery project is different, so their problems are. Still, I have collected a handful ideas that make sense to consider. In this session I would like to show you some of these, through examples from real projects wherever it is possible. You will see in detail the application of the page object pattern, the organization of Ghekin files to a feature tree and also the different ways of applying the default value pattern. These ideas are shown in scope of .NET and SpecFlow, but also applicable to automated testing solutions in other fields.",

      "Description": "The ideas behind BDD, Specification by Example and Agile acceptance testing are deceivingly simple, but have proved far from easy to implement. Yet most of the complaints online come from misunderstood ideas which lead to misguided attempts. Gojko Adzic will bust the myths around these techniques and show how successful teams all over the world use them to successfully deliver the right stuff using these techniques.",
